paperplanner
===============================================================================

This repository contains the template for the week planner I use in my 
notebook.

The notebook is more or less A6 size, has a ring binder, and tabs. This works 
very well for me: it makes for a single object that carries all my schedule 
and notes; my fountain pen fits neatly into the rings; scrap paper can be 
given a second life by cutting it into the right size; and the pages can be 
freely rearranged or increased. I also find that it's easier to act 
intentionally when my organizational habits are offline.

My handwriting is very small, so for now, the script crams a whole week into a 
single page, which has the dimensions 16.3cm Ã— 10cm. The dividing lines 
between the days have a 24-hour 'measuring tape' which allows me to mark 
certain events or keep track of my sleeping times.

The template right now is a first draft. I intend to write a script that 
generates the pages with the correct dates, using something like 
[pyephem](https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) for moving the little sun icon 
according to calculated sunrise times for that week.
